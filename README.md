#### A simple group packing app

TODO:

- [x] Decide between mongoose or mongodb driver (mongoose since most data will be structured, but mongodb driver could also work as long as some sort of schema is eforced)
- - Went with mongo driver + joi. Also makes sense to just use a SQL DB but wanted to switch it up.
- [x] Set up server in it's basic form (express, http, io)
- [x] Design and create model for a "item" entry for the items list
- [x] Implement frontend to create a "room" with a unique id
- [ ] Work on join room event for a ids
